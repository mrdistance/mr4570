			<h1>VERSATILITY</h1>
			<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.45-70" target ="blank">45-70</a> is perhaps the most versatile rifle caliber ever produced.  For the daily plinker who wants to feel like a cowboy, to the avid hunter who is surrounded by dense forests and heavy brush, up to the nature enthusiasts of the unforgiving Alaskan Wilderness, surrounded by the massive Brown Bear and ferocious Grizzly, and even across the vast ocean to the wilds of Africa and the most dangerous game on the planet, the 45-70 Government can, and has, done it all.</p>

			<h1>PLINKING</h1>
			<p>For those of you intrigued with guns for the purpose of 'fun', first, I don't blame you, and second, as a 'fun to shoot' gun, the 45-70 is hard to beat.  Aside from looking good, This gun can shoot anywhere from 150 to 550 grain bullets, either slow and gentle for the recoil sensitive, or fast and punishing for those who can stand the pain.  If you do not know how to handload ammunition, now is the time to learn!  Off the shelves 45-70 ammunition ranges from 1-5 dollars per shot!  Don't let that stop you though, as I personally plink with a 150 grain zinger all the way up to a subsonic 550 grain whopper, hand cast, hand loaded bullets, behind 10 grains of unique, at the wopping cost of 6.5 cents per shot, after an initial investment of less than $200.</p>

			<h1>HUNTING</h1>
			<p>The 45-70 is a great choice for hunting!  Many people would suggest it has a maximum range of about 200 yards, but I contest that you could take it as far as 500 yards effectively if you practice and know your bullets. The typical hunting bullets weigh in around 300 grains and are moving around 2000 feet per second from the factory.  This produces over 3000 foot pounds of energy on impact.  With a hollow point this will give you sufficient penetration for most game and velocity will produce hydrostatic shock between 1700-2400 feet per second. Furthermore, with bullets such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abUQQYQuBcg" target = "_blank">extreme penetrator</a>, penetration is sufficient for anything you set your eyes on.  If having a bullet that "only" weighs 100 grains more than most other popular hunting calibers doesn't satisfy you enough, you can purchase, or make, a 400 grain (the most common bear protection load weight) or 500 grain (if you don't trust 400 grains) projectile that will suit any hunting application or game animal in North America and has even been used to take down the <a href="https://www.garrettcartridges.com/luposafaris.html" target = "_blank">Big Five of Africa</a>.</p></section>

			<h1>SURVIVAL</h1>
			<p>As you can see, the 45-70 is extremely versatile, making it an exceptional choice for those seeking to purchase just one gun and one caliber to perform all of their survival needs.  Light projectiles can be lightly loaded to handle the smallest of critters or sent blazing across the sky to take care of nuisance predators.  Medium sized projectiles can handle any medium game animals without punishing the shooters shoulder, or loaded to optimal perfomance to take down bigger game at greater distances.  Large projectiles can be used when walking in dangerous country and wanting a reliable 'momma bear'/'stop her in her tracks' type of bullet.  Not only this, but there are many competitions that use large heavy 45-70 projectiles to shooot distances up to a mile accurately once the shooter learns how his or her bullet curves through the air.</p>
