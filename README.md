Website catering to all 45-70 caliber rifles and pistols
This was my first website build.  I have a love for the 45-70 rifle and was not happy with current ammo prices being around $2 per shot.
I created this website to help anyone looking to reduce these costs by taking up handloading.  I have provided vast amounts of load data along with
videos and personal tests to help further the capabilites of this great caliber.
