The purpose of this website is to cater to all 45-70 caliber rifle and pistol owners.
This was my first website build.  I have a love for the 45-70 rifle and was not happy with current ammo prices being around $2 per shot.
I created this website to help anyone looking to reduce these costs by taking up handloading by giving them free access
to load data from various powders and bullet weights to suit a variety of needs.  I have provided vast amounts of load data along with
videos and personal tests to help further the capabilites of this great caliber.  If you have load data you would like me to post on the site feel free
to share and I will get it up on the site as soon as possible.
