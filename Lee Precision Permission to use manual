Dear Mr Call

Sounds like an interesting project. We would have no objection to using the load data listed in our book. However because our load data is provided to us by the powder manufactures you might be better served using our book as a reference and retrieving the most current data from the powder manufactures. We do parse the data for correctness and sort in velocity descending order. We also add starting loads and volume measurements. We also select only loads that will be safe under varying conditions.
You"ll find the powder manufactures are very specific with their load data, example bullet brand, primer type and brand and specific seating depth. 


Sincerely, 

John Lee, President
