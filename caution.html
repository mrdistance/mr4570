		<p>Guns don't kill people, people kill people.  Please refrain from doing anything stupid with your firearms.  Guns are by no means toys, but rather they are TOOLS.  Buying a gun for the purpose of fun is a wasted venture, because sooner or later it will bite you in the butt.  There have been a few occasions where I failed to remember this, and had I not been following at least a few safety guidelines I, or a member of my family, might very well be dead right now.  When it comes to guns accidents result in tragedy.  Learn and practice proper gun safety religiously.  Here are just a few things to be aware of while performing gun related activities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Never point your gun in an unsafe direction, treat it as if it were loaded at all times</li>
			<li>Wear proper safety equipment when shooting, eye and ear protection are a good start</li>
			<li>Clean your gun regularly</li>
			<li>Store your firearm and ammunition in a secure location, possibly even in seperate locations</li>
			<li>When reloading be aware of pressure specifications for your firearm and do not surpass them</li>
			<li>When shooting steel, maintain appropriate distances to reduce the risk of ricochet injury</li>
			</ul>
