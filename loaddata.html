		<p>One of the best ways to get to know your firearm better is to reload its ammunition yourself.  I will continually update this page as I develop more handloads and utilize more powders.  Eventually I will organize this data by powder type, and provide minimum, maximum, and favorite powder charges for a variety of bullet weights from 150 grains to 525 grains.  This will provide you with a starting point for any bullet weight you wish to load with any powder you might have on hand.  Remember, these are just references, and you should always start at or below the minimum charge and develop your own personal data that works for you and your rifle.  I have also included some reference pictures for common animal sizes and vital organ placement below.</p><br><br>
			<p><h1>PRESSURE CATEGORIES</h1>
			In general terms, there are 3 distinct types of rifles and loads available to a person seeking to experience the joy of the 45-70. Each category inherits all the abilities and perfomance of the one preceding it, however, rifle configuration, size, and action style have slight variations between groups.<br><br>
			  
			<h3>LOW PRESSURES</h3>
			The oldest, and weakest of these is classified as a 'trapdoor' lever action rifle, commonly referring to the original Trapdoor Springfields produced for use by the United States Army in 1873.  Maximum pressures for this rifle catagory are generally cited at a maximum of 28,000 CPU. Within this pressure a 300 grain projectile can be shot at a velocity of roughly 1800 feet per second out of a 24 inch barrel. Due to the existence and continued use of this category of rifle, most factory ammunition is loaded down for safe use in them unless otherwise stated on the box.<br><br>

			<h3>MODERATE PRESSURES</h3>
			The second classification, referred to on most websites by the term 'Modern Lever Action', consists of such rifles as the Marlin 1895 lines of lever actions as well as Henry lever actions, just to name a few.  Maximum pressures are generally rated at 40,000 CPU which send that same 300 grain projectile upwards of nearly 2400 feet per second out of a 24 inch barrel.  To purchase ammunition with a little more kick to it, and a little more takedown power, look for brands that specify +P or specifically state that they are intended solely for use in 'modern' 45-70 rifles.<br><br>

			<h3>HIGH PRESSURES</h3>
			Lastly, the final category of 45-70 rifles are the single shots and a few custom bolt actions, the most reknowned being the Ruger No. 1.  The maximum safe pressure attainable is said to be around 50,000 CPU, allowing a 300 grain bullet to shoot out at just over 2500 feet per second.  I am unaware of any manufacturers that specifically brand their ammunition toward this category of the 45-70, simple because it is so narrow and the ratio of pain to gain for a slighly faster bullet is often not worth it.  If this is the rifle type you desire, look into reloading your own ammunition so as to be able to take full advantage of its greater capacity.<br><br>

			Reguardless of the rifle you own, or wish to purchase, there is a large variety of factory ammunition, as well as an unimaginable amount of handloads, that can be fired from it, for both recreational and serious applications.<br><br>

			<h3>*NOTE*</h3>
			Most factory ammunition velocities are measured out of a 24 inch barrel.  If you are curious to know how fast a projectile will fire out a shorter barrel, the general rule of thumb is to subtract 25 feet per second per inch of barrel difference.  However, this does not usually apply in reverse order due to the simple fact that powder only needs so much barrel to completely burn without waste, and after optimum length is acheived, your bullet is no longer accelerating, reguardless of how much longer your barrel is.</p>
