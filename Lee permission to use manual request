Dear Mr. Lee,

My name is Joshua Call, I have been building a website as a school/hobby project for the intent of sharing my love for the great 45-70 cartridge.  I have used your Modern Reloading manual to learn many things about hand-loading and it has been a great help to me in developing my own personal load data.  I am requesting your permission to include some of the load data from your book in  my website so others can benefit and enjoy the 45-70 as much as I have.  Specifically, I wish to include(from the section on reloading for the 45-70) Powder Name, C.O.A.L, Bullet Weight, Max Charge, Velocity, and Pressure.  I would organize this data in a table alongside load data from other reloading manuals.  I will credit your manual in my work and include a direct link to your website so users may buy the original manual and benefit from the other useful information it contains.  My website is www.mr45-70.com.  I respectfully await your response.

Thank you, 
Joshua Call.
